THUYG20 is an open Uyghur speech database published by Center for Speech and Language Technology (CSLT) at Tsinghua University, Signal and Information Processing Lab at Xinjiang University, and the AI cloud research center (AICRC). It involves the full set of speech and language resoruces required to establish an Uyghur speech recognition system and an Uyghur speaker recognition system, plus the scripts to reproduce the reference results.

This directory (thuyg20_sre) contains example scripts for speaker identification,
not speech recognition.

The database can be downloaded from openslr:
http://www.openslr.org/19/
or from the CSLT server:
http://data.cslt.org/thuyg20/README.html
http://data.cslt.org/thuyg20-sre/README.html

The subdirectories "v1" and so on are different versions of the recipe.
